What is a working group? 

‘Working groups are short-lived, temporary teams of diverse contributors created to solve a cross pod problem’.

Short-lived: Working groups must have a clear end to their existence. 

Temporary: Working groups do not live on an organizational chart, and the group’s work isn’t anyone’s primary responsibility. 

Diverse: The members of the working group all see the problem in different ways.

Cross pod issue: Working groups only address cross-pod problems; otherwise, an individual team could manage the problem themselves. 

When is a working group the answer to your problem? 

Start by asking yourself and your peers the following questions: 
Does this problem really exist?
Are other team members affected by this problem?
Would others agree that someone should fix this problem?
Is the problem currently ownerless? 

If the answer is no to any of these questions, a working group is likely not the best solution.

A working group is the logical next step, now what?

Set a goal
Define what is/is not the responsibility of the group. This will be useful in knowing if the working group is successful. Review this goal regularly to keep everyone focused. 

Designate a facilitator
This person will be responsible for running meetings, keeping the group on task and holding members accountable. This person is not necessarily management. Anyone can act as a facilitator. Working groups can be a great opportunity for more junior members to take on a leadership role.
 
Define operations
How will the group communicate? Consider leveraging existing norms like standups, check-ins, slack channels, jira boards, retrospective meetings etc.

Set milestones
Without milestones how do we measure the pace of our work? This will also keep expectations reasonable.

Operate Transparently
How do you plan to keep others aware of the group’s progress? Consider open meetings, newsletter, and slack channels.
